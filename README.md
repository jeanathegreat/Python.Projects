# Python.Projects
Here lies my attempts at creating some of my personal python projects

Project 1: NAVPS
- scrapes through all my email items sent by Sunlife which details the daily market price of unit trust funds
- notifies me when above market price is 10-20% below average market price for the last 3-6months
- creates graphical plots of the data taken from the email
